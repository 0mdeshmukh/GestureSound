# GestureSound 🎶✋

**GestureSound** is an innovative, hands-free system that allows users to control their device's volume using simple hand gestures. Whether you're cooking, exercising, or multitasking, now you can adjust your audio settings without ever touching a button. 🙌

## Features 🚀
- **Hands-Free Control**: Adjust your device's volume using hand gestures.
- **Easy Setup**: Uses a webcam and MediaPipe for hand tracking, no special hardware required.
- **Intuitive Gestures**: 
  - Pointing your index finger up increases the volume 🔊
  - Pointing your index finger down decreases the volume 🔉
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with any device that has a camera.

## How It Works 🧠
GestureSound detects hand gestures in real time using MediaPipe's advanced hand tracking capabilities. The system tracks the position of the index finger and thumb, and depending on their relative positions, it triggers volume control actions. The PyAutoGUI library is used to simulate the volume adjustments on your system.

## Demo 📽️
